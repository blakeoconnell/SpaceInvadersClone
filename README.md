# Space Invaders Clone

A clone of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. Developed in Python using the Turtle module.

# What I Learned

* OOP (building and managing all ships and defenses as objects)
* Playing sounds in Python (missiles, explosions)
* Multithreading (individual threads for sounds, so gameplay is not halted)
